# Euruject

Since Eurucamp had to reject over 100 proposals, the idea rose to do a "reject-conf". Although it's really just an excuse to get together, hack and share ideas some time during the Eurucamp week.

As opposed to a "real" conference, Euruject is meant to be loosely organized, grassroots, bottom up, for us by us. That means there is no central organization or authority. Things are meant to be discussed until concencus is reached. Everyone is welcome to join the dialogue!
