## Code of Conduct

We adopt the [Ruby Berlin Code of Conduct](http://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/). By attending you agree to comply to this code, please read it carefully before attending the event.

* arne.brasseur@gmail.com ; 0176974680141

## Reporting Harassment

When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident - Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

  * Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing
  * The behavior that was in violation
  * The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)
  * The circumstances surrounding the incident
  * Other people involved in the incident

If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request. If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement. If you do not have a cell phone, you can ask a staff member.

## What is it

Since eurucamp had to reject over 100 proposals, the idea rose to do a "reject-conf". Although it's really just an excuse to get together, hack and share ideas some time during the eurucamp week.

As opposed to a "real" conference, Euruject is meant to be loosely organized, grassroots, bottom up, for us by us. Everyone is welcome to join the dialogue!

Have a look at the issue tracker for ongoing discussions.

## What to bring with you

A computer, although it's not mandatory.

If you can, please bring a power/plug strip with you. Just remember to sign it (or mark it in another way), so that it won't get lost during the day. Every power strip counts!

Food is very much welcome! If you want to bring stuff to share, think about considering people with dietary restrictions.
