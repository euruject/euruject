## Code of Concduct

We adopt the [Ruby Berlin Code of Conduct](http://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/). By attending you agree to comply to this code, please read it carefully before attending the event.

## What is it

Since Eurucamp had to reject over 100 proposals, the idea rose to do a "reject-conf". Although it's really just an excuse to get together, hack and share ideas some time during the Eurucamp week.

As opposed to a "real" conference, Euruject is meant to be loosely organized, grassroots, bottom up, for us by us. Everyone is welcome to join the dialogue!

Have a look at the issue tracker for ongoing discussions.
